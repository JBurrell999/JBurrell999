Hi, I’m James Burrell and I am a researcher at the University of San Francisco in the MAGICS Lab under Dr.Brizan. My focus is in NLP and ML and intend to pursue
a higher education degree in Computer Science. This will be a repository both of my research work and of that for my personal projects/ pratice problems of text books which I read. The best way to reach is by my email at jjburrell@dons.usfca.edu for any collaberations or questions.
