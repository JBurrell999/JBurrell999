Hi, I’m James Burrell, a student at the university of San Francisco California. This will be a repository both of my research work and of that for my personal projects/ pratice problems of text books which I read. The best way to reach is by my email at jjburrell@dons.usfca.edu for any collaberations or questions.

<!---
JBurrell999/JBurrell999 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
